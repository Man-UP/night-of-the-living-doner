frame 1 - 20: idle
frame 20 - 39: punch
frame 40 - 46: damage (recieved)
frame 47 - 67: exploded

I will soon add the buttons popping out, so for that just make placeholders for additional animation

also, for the eating game, how it will work is after the exploding animation, advance a frame to eat a piece until he is gone
